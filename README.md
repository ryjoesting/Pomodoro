# Pomodoro - an enhanced study timer

From Wikipedia: The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student. Closely related to concepts such as timeboxing and iterative and incremental development used in software design, the method has been adopted in pair programming contexts.

As a univeristy student currently, I use this method often in order to effectively manage my study time and avoid distractions. I've found that it helps me to stay motivated on a single task, and allows me to get into the flow state of mind. 

This project is part of freeCodeCamp's Front End curriculum. It features adjustable work and break lenths, and also triggers an HTML audio element when the timer ends. I used React to create this.
